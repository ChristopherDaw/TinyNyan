Nyan cat, but on the Tiny Arcade by Tiny Circuits.

This little program appears much like the original gif of Nyancat, but it allows you to control the cat around the arcade's screen with the joystick.  You can also have it shoot donuts with the buttons.

Thanks to Tiny Circuits for [their tutorial](https://tinycircuits.com/blogs/learn/how-to-develop-a-game-for-the-tinyarcade-new "Tiny Arcade Programming Intro") that got me started down this rainbow-filled rabit (cat) hole.

Thanks also to Christopher Torres (@PRguitarman) for creating the Pop-Tart/cat mashup gif.
